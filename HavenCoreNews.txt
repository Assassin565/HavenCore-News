7/30/2021 Server Change Log

@Fusions Member We know you were exited for a Beta release of DBC Fusions today but unfortunately we'll have to postpone release a bit longer. This is mainly due to several power outages affecting myself which delayed the work needed to finish a new HavenCore feature. It is an addon to the Custom NPC Wand made specifically for DBC in order to make life easier for our Quest Makers and to avoid server crashes from NPC Scripting. The HavenCore's DBC NPC Wand currently plans to allow for:

1. The capability of balancing Custom NPCs like DBC Players through stats.
2. NPCs to dodge attacks based on the DBC stat difference of who attacks it. Alternatively, you can input a manual percentage chance that the NPC would dodge with. 
3. NPCs to do critical strike damage and allow users to adjust the chance they critically strike.
4. Giving NPCs the ability to fly for aerial combat. Also being able to set how fast they can fly
5. Providing NPCs with a selection of player Custom Forms, and a customizable form allowing the user to set each individual multiplier and choose what kind of aura.
6. Allowing staff to customize and have the NPC fire Ki Attacks powered by the NPC's DBC stats
7. The capability to run more than one command for rewards upon NPC death.

This is all going to be tested during Fusions Beta. However we will need some more time to iron this out. An estimate of how long it'll be delayed will be posted by @Netsu the Machiavellian later on.
