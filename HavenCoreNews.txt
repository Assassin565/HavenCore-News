@Fusions Member 
I know everyone is probably wondering if Fusions development is still alive, and I'm here to say yes, nothing has stopped. That being said, I wish you all a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year along with new ðŸ“°fs-teasers to set you guys off towards the New Years! :HypedPanda: 

Mod Content
Character Slots- This feature will replace Prestiging. Instead of extending your character's capabilities, why not start anew on a new slot with a fresh start? This feature allows you to pick and choose a slot that you've created and start with a new race, or class.

Custom Wishes- Tired of the basic DBC Wish System? Use the new and improved Wish system with the Super Dragon Balls. Collect and convert Regular/Namekian Dragon Balls to obtain all seven Super Dragon Balls to summon Super Shenron.

Server Content
Builds - A Capsule Transportation build as well as a update to spawn with a Futuristic City towards the west side.
