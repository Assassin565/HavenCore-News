@HavenCore Member , I am proud to announce an upcoming event for Dragon Block C Fusions! August 7th, 2021 at 3:00 PM Eastern Standard Time we will launch a Q&A session! At the start of the event, we will also be releasing the scheduled date for closed beta!

Have any questions or concerns about the server that you would like to clarify? Want to talk about the direction of the server? Curious on if we will cover the manga or anime? If you have a question, feel free to ask it!

We will be doing this through the new threads feature, players who could not make the initial event will have twenty four hours to utilize it before it is archived. At the end of the event, we will also be posting teasers.

But wait, there is more! Alongside the Q&A, there will be two giveaways for beta testers. The first one will be on the Discord and have three winners. The second will be based on the participants list in the thread. At the end of the event, the list of participants will be put through a wheel of fortune, two winners will be selected from this. 

Don't miss out on the chance to be among the first to experience the server! I can't wait to see you all there! Also, feel free to check #ðŸ“°fs-teasers for a glimpse of new spawn, more to be displayed in the event!
